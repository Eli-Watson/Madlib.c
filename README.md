# Madlib.c
This is a madlib generator written in pure good ole' C. This is my first "real"
C program, as is my general go-to when learning a new language. This implementation 
has quite a larger possible amount of combinations, I am not sure on the actual amount but 
it chooses from a pool of 100 adjectives, nouns, colors, numbers, and verbs, along with 
20 different possible story's. 

# User guide
